     In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
     Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:

       <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>

          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
          Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
          sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
          <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

          You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
          Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
          at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
          tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
